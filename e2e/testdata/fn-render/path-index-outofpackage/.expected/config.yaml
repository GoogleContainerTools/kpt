# This package is nonIdempotent because functions in the subpackage (db)
# do not have knowledge of the resources outside of this package. Therefore
# when it runs twice, it tries to recreate the same resource in the directory,
# resulting in a filepath conflict and throwing an error.
nonIdempotent: true
