# Releasing

## Steps

To cut a new kpt release perform the following:

- Ensure kpt is importing the latest dependent releases
  - [cli-utils](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/tree/master/release)
  - Within kustomize: [kyaml](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/releasing)
  - Within kustomize: [cmd/config](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/releasing)
  - Update `go.mod` file with correct versions of `cli-utils`, `kyaml`, and `cmd/config`
  - Run `make all` (which should update `go.sum` and run `go mod tidy`)
  - Create a `kpt` PR with previous `go.mod` and `go.sum` changes, and submit. [Example PR](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/pull/594)
- Fetch the latest master changes to a clean branch
  - `git checkout -b release`
  - `git fetch upstream`
  - `git reset --hard upstream/master`
- Tag the commit
  - `git tag v0.MINOR.0`
  - `git push upstream v0.MINOR.0`
- Update the Homebrew release
  - `go run ./release/formula/main.go v0.MINOR.0`
  - `git add . && git commit -m "update homebrew to v0.MINOR.0"`
  - create a PR for this change and merge it
  - [example PR](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/pull/331/commits/baf33d8ed214f2c5e106ec6e963ad736e5ff4d98#diff-d69e3adb302ee3e84814136422cbf872)

## Artifacts

Release artifacts such as binaries and images will be built automatically by Cloud Build in the
`kpt-dev` GCP project.  The binaries linked from the README.md docs will be automatically updated
because they point to the `latest` binaries which are updated for tagged releases.  Images are
also updated with the `latest` tag for tagged releases.

- `kpt-dev` release buckets
  - `gs://kpt-dev/latest`
  - `gs://kpt-dev/releases`

# Testing the Release Process

## Running Cloud Build Locally

You can use [`cloud-build-local`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-build-local)
to run kpt's Cloud Build builds locally with custom parameters (`--substitutions`)
and dry-runs (`--dryrun`) to validate the builds syntax.

You will need to provide `--substitutions` for `TAG_NAME`, `_VERSION`,
`_GCS_BUCKET` and `_GITHUB_USER`. In a `--dryrun` these do not need to align
with existing resources. For example:

```sh
cloud-build-local --config=release/tag/cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions=TAG_NAME=test,_VERSION=test,_GCS_BUCKET=test,_GITHUB_USER=test --dryrun=true .
```

When running with `--dryrun=false` you will need to do some initial work to run
against your forked version of kpt:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If your change depends on code changes (any file other than `cloudbuild.yaml`)
you will need to check in and tag those changes when following these steps.
Otherwise the first steps that checkout the code will not include your local
changes and all future steps will not include those changes. This includes any
modifications to `goreleaser.yaml`!

1. Setup your gcloud profile.
2. Create a enable the Google Cloud Secret Manager on the profile
3. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token and save it as `github-token` in the
Google Cloud Secrets Manager.

```sh
‚ûú gcloud secrets create github-token
```

4. Assign `--substitutions=_GITHUB_USER={your github username}`. Do **not** use
`GoogleContainerTools` (this would attempt to create a release for
`GoogleContainerTools/kpt`).
5. Create a tag on your fork. Assign that name to the `TAG_NAME`
substitution (multiple substitutions are comma delimated: FOO=a,BAR=b).

```sh
‚ûú git tag my-test-release
‚ûú git push origin my-test-release
```

6. Create a Cloud Storage bucket and assign its name to `_GCS_BUCKET` in a
substitution.
7. Assign a `_VERSION` substition. This will impact the results of
`kpt version`.
8. Run `cloud-build-local` with the updated substitutions.

> `cloud-build-local` will use `--dryrun=true` by default. This will allow you
to validate your substitutions and syntax. To perform an actual run (including
releasing and publishing images to your gcr/storage/github) set
`--dryrun=false`.

9. Grab a coffee ‚òï or your favorite tea üçµ this process is not quick.
10. Once this is done the tag you chose in step 5 should now be a release and
the kpt containers should be in your container registry.

## Dry-Run Goreleaser

To test local changes to the [`goreleaser.yaml`](./tag/goreleaser.yaml) config. You may
[install goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/) locally and provide the
`--skip-verify --skip-publish` flags.

Set the GitHub User ENV to your username:

```sh
export _GITHUB_USER=YourUsername
```

From the kpt directory you can run the following to validate your release:

```sh
goreleaser release --skip-validate --skip-publish -f release/tag/goreleaser.yaml
```

The resulting release artifacts will be stored in the `./dist` directory.
