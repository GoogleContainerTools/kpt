[Chapter 2][ch2] provided a high-level conceptual explanation of functions. We discussed how this
architecture enables us to develop functions in different toolchains, languages and runtimes.
this chapter, we are going to look at several different approaches to developing functions.

We are also going to take a closer look at the standardized API between the orchestrator (i.e. kpt
CLI) and the function containers. Understanding this API enables you to have a deeper understanding
of how things work under the hood. It also enables you to create your own toolchain for function
development if you so desire.
