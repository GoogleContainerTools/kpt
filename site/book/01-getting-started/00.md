Welcome to the _The kpt Book_, a step-by-step introduction to _kpt_, a tool for packaging,
customizing, validating, and applying configuration using the Kubernetes Resource Model.
As much as possible, the aim is to use examples to explain the features and the underlying design
principles.

This book is organized as follows:

- Chapter 1 is a quickstart to get you oriented with kpt and sets up the context for the rest
  of the book.
- Chapter 2 introduces the fundamental concepts in kpt.
- Chapter 3 covers how to work with kpt packages.
- Chapter 4 covers how to use kpt functions to automate configuration changes.
- Chapter 5 guides you through developing custom functions.
- Chapter 6 covers how to apply a package to a Kubernetes cluster.

Let's get started!
