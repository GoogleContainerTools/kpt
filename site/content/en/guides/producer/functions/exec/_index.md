   Writing and running functions as executables

{{% pageinfo color="warning" %}}
The Exec runtime is Alpha. It is disabled by default, and must be enabled with
the `--enable-exec` flag.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Config functions may be run as executables outside of containers. Exec
functions read input and write output like container functions, but are run
outside of a container.

Running functions as executables can be useful for function development, or for
running trusted executables.

{{% pageinfo color="info" %}}
Exec functions may be converted to container functions by building the
executable into a container and invoking it as the container's `CMD` or
`ENTRYPOINT`.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Imperative Run

Exec functions may be run imperatively using the `--exec-path` flag with
`kpt fn run`.

```sh
kpt fn run DIR/ --enable-exec --exec-path /path/to/executable
```

This is similar to building `/path/to/executable` into the container image
`gcr.io/project/image:tag` and running -- except that the executable has access
to the local machine.

```sh
kpt fn run DIR/ --image gcr.io/project/image:tag
```

Just like container functions, exec functions accept input as arguments after
`--`.

```sh
kpt fn run DIR/ --enable-exec --exec-path /path/to/executable -- foo=bar
```

## Declarative Run

Exec functions may also be run by declaring the function in a resource using
the `config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation.

To run the declared function use `kpt fn run DIR/ --enable-exec` on the
directory containing the example.

```yaml
apiVersion: example.com/v1beta1
kind: ExampleKind
metadata:
  name: function-input
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      exec:
        path: /path/to/executable
```

Note: if the `--enable-exec` flag is not provided, `kpt fn run DIR/` will
ignore the exec function and exit 0.

## Typescript Function Example

You may want to run a function developed with one of the config function SDKs
using the exec runtime in order to avoid the overhead associated with running
a container. To run your function in the exec runtime, you will first need to
package your function as an executable.

We walk through an example of running a typescript function using the kpt exec
runtime.

### Prerequisites

- Install the pkg CLI.

  ```sh
  npm install -g pkg
  ```

- Install your kpt-functions package module to create your function's
  distributable file.

  ```sh
  npm i
  ```

### Steps

1. Use the pkg CLI to create an executable from your function's distributable
   file. For a `my_fn` function built using the typescript SDK, this is
   `dist/my_fn_run.js`.

   ```sh
   npx pkg dist/my_fn_run.js
   ```

1. Pass the path to the appropriate executable for your OS when running kpt
   using the exec runtime.

   ```sh
   kpt fn run DIR/ --enable-exec --exec-path /path/to/my_fn_run-macos -- a=b
   ```
