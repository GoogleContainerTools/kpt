## Functions Explained

When an operation requires more than just the schema, and data is necessary,
the logic for the operation can be built into a configuration function using
general purpose programming languages. Functions bundle the operation logic and
can apply that logic to the contents of a package -- modifying and validating
package contents.

Kpt offers multiple runtimes for configuration functions to run arbitrary
actions on configuration. By default kpt runs configuration functions in a
container runtime, but it also provides runtimes for functions packaged as
executables or starlark scripts.

Functions provide a common interface for writing programs to read and write
resources as data. This enables greater reuse and composition than when
configuration is itself represented as code. Functions may be written in any
language, or simply wrap other existing programs.

Functions can address many types of workflows, including:

- Generating resources from some inputs (like client-side CRDs)
- Applying cross-cutting transformations (e.g., set a field on all resources
  that look like this)
- Validating resources conform to best practices defined by the organization
  (e.g., must specify tag as part of the image)
- Sending resources to a destination (e.g., saving them locally or deploying
  them to a cluster)

## Running Functions

Functions may be run either imperatively using the form
`kpt fn run DIR/ --image some-image:version`, or they may be run declaratively
using the form `kpt fn run DIR/`.

Either way, `kpt fn run` will

1. read the package directory `DIR/` as input
2. encapsulate the package resources in a `ResourceList`
3. run the function(s), providing the ResourceList as input
4. write the function(s) output back to the package directory; creating,
   deleting, or updating resources

### Imperative Run

Functions can be run imperatively by specifying the `--image` flag.

**Example:** Locally run the container image
`gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace` against the resources in `.`.

Letâ€™s look at the example of imperatively running a function to set a label
value. The ([label-namespace]) container image contains a program which adds a
label to all Namespace resources provided to it.

Run the function:

```sh
kpt fn run . --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace -- label_name=color label_value=orange
```

Arguments specified after `--` will be provided to the function as a
`ConfigMap` input containing `data: {label_name: color, label_value: orange}`.
This is used to parameterize the behavior of the function.

If the package directory `.` is not specified, the source will default to STDIN
and sink will default to STDOUT.

**Example:** This is equivalent to the preceding example

```sh
kpt source . |
  kpt fn run --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace -- label_name=color label_value=orange |
  kpt sink .
```

The above example commands will:

- read all resources from the package directory `.` to generate input resources
- parse the arguments into a functionConfig field along with input resources
- create a container from the image
- provide the input to the function (container)
- write the output items back to the package directory `.`

### Declarative Run

Functions and their input configuration may be declared in files rather than
directly on the command line. The declarative method will be the most common
way of invoking config functions in production. Functions can be specified
declaratively using the `config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation on a
resource serving as the functionConfig.

**Example:** Equivalent to the imperative run example

We can run the same [label-namespace] example declaratively, which means we
make a reusable function configuration resource which contains all information
necessary to run the function, from container image to argument values. Once we
create file with this information we can check it into [VCS] and run the
function in a repeatable fashion, making it incredibly powerful for production
use.

Create a file `label-ns-fc.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      container:
        image: gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace
data:
  "label_name": "color"
  "label_value": "orange"
```

This file contains a `config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation specifying the
docker image to use for the config as well as a data field containing a
key-value map with the "label_name" and "label_value" arguments specified
earlier. Using a map also makes it easier to pass more complex arguments values
like a list of strings.

Run the function:

```sh
kpt fn run . # without `--image`
```

The example command will:

- read all resources from the package directory `.` to generate input resources
- for each resource with the `config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation, e.g.
  `label-ns-fc.yaml`, kpt will run the specified function (using the resource
  as the functionConfig)
  - functions are run sequentially, with the output of each function provided
    as input to the next
- write the output items back to the package directory `.`

Here, rather than specifying `gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace` using the
`--image` flag, we specify it in a file using the
`config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation.
