Update a local package with changes from a remote source repo

![alt text][demo]

### Synopsis

    kpt update LOCAL_PKG_DIR[@VERSION] [flags]

  LOCAL_PKG_DIR:

    Local package to update.  Directory must exist and contain a Kptfile to be updated.

  VERSION:

  	A git tag, branch, ref or commit.  Specified after the local_package with @ -- pkg@version.
    Defaults the local package version that was last fetched.

	Version types:

    * branch: update the local contents to the tip of the remote branch
    * tag: update the local contents to the remote tag
    * commit: update the local contents to the remote commit

  --strategy:

    Controls how changes to the local package are handled.  Defaults to fast-forward.

    * resource-merge: perform a structural comparison of the original / updated Resources, and merge
	  the changes into the local package.  See `kpt help apis merge3` for details on merge.
    * fast-forward: fail without updating if the local package was modified since it was fetched.
    * alpha-git-patch: use 'git format-patch' and 'git am' to apply a patch of the
      changes between the source version and destination version.
      **REQUIRES THE LOCAL PACKAGE TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO A LOCAL GIT REPO.**
    * force-delete-replace: THIS WILL WIPE ALL LOCAL CHANGES TO
      THE PACKAGE.  DELETE the local package at local_pkg_dir/ and replace it
      with the remote version.

  -r, --repo string

    Git repo url for updating contents.  Defaults to the repo the package was fetched from.

  --dry-run

    Print the 'alpha-git-patch' strategy patch rather than merging it.

#### Env Vars

  KPT_CACHE_DIR:

    Controls where to cache remote packages when fetching them to update local packages.
    Defaults to ~/.kpt/repos/

### Examples

    # update my-package-dir/
    kpt pkg update my-package-dir/
