#### Design

1. **Packages are composed of Resource configuration** (rather than DSLs, templates, etc)
    * May also contain supplemental non-Resource artifacts (e.g. README.md, arbitrary other files).

2.  **Any existing git subdirectory containing Resource configuration** may be used as a package.
    * Nothing besides a git directory containing Resource configuration is required.
    * e.g. the [examples repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/staging/cockroachdb) may
      be used as a package:

          # fetch the examples cockroachdb directory as a package
          kpt get https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/staging/cockroachdb my-cockroachdb

3. **Packages should use git references for versioning**.
    * Package authors should use semantic versioning when publishing packages.

          # fetch the examples cockroachdb directory as a package
          kpt get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/examples/cockroachdb@v0.1.0 my-cockroachdb

4. **Packages may be modified or customized in place**.
    * It is possible to directly modify the fetched package.
    * Tools may set or change fields.
    * [Functions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/commands/run-fns.md)
      may also be applied to the local copy of the package.

          export KUSTOMIZE_ENABLE_ALPHA_COMMANDS=true

          kpt get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/examples/cockroachdb my-cockroachdb
          kpt set my-cockroachdb/ replicas 5

5. **The same package may be fetched multiple times** to separate locations.
    * Each instance may be modified and updated independently of the others.

          export KUSTOMIZE_ENABLE_ALPHA_COMMANDS=true

          # fetch an instance of a java package
          kpt get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/examples/java my-java-1
          kpt set my-java-1/ image gcr.io/example/my-java-1:v3.0.0

          # fetch a second instance of a java package
          kpt get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/examples/java my-java-2
          kpt set my-java-2/ image gcr.io/example/my-java-2:v2.0.0

6. **Packages may pull upstream updates after they have been fetched and modified**.
    * Specify the target version to update to, and an (optional) update strategy for how to apply the
      upstream changes.

          export KUSTOMIZE_ENABLE_ALPHA_COMMANDS=true

          kpt get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/examples/cockroachdb my-cockroachdb
          kpt set my-cockroachdb/ replicas 5
          kpt update my-cockroachdb@v1.0.1 --strategy=resource-merge

#### Building Platforms, Solutions and High-Level Systems with kpt

kpt was developed to solve **configuration packaging** only -- and was designed to be composed
with other tools from the ecosystem in order to build higher-level systems and platforms.

As such, **kpt has a minimal feature set by design to maximize its utility as a building block
for platforms** and ability to be composed with other tools.

This sections provides a high-level overview of some of the ways in which kpt may be composed
with tools from the upstream Kubernetes project to build configuration and delivery solutions.

See [building-solutions](tutorials/building-solutions.md) for a more information on this topic.

1. **Packaging**

   Packaging covers how to bundle configuration for reuse.

   - Fetch -- get a bundle of Resource configuration
   - Update -- pull in upstream changes to Resource configuration
   - Publish -- publish a bundle of Resource configuration

2. **Development**

   Development covers how to create and modify configuration, and includes
   how to incorporate and unify opinions from an arbitrary number of sources.

   - Abstraction -- substitution, generation, injection, etc
   - Customization -- configuring blueprints, defining variants, etc
   - Validation -- policy enforcement, linting, etc

3. **Actuation**

   Actuation covers how to take configuration and actuate it by applying it.

   - Apply -- apply configuration to a cluster
   - Status -- waiting for changes to be fully rolled out
   - Prune -- deletion of Resources no longer appearing in the config

4. **Visibility** /  **Inspection**

   Visibility / Inspection covers how to visualize and understand packaged
   configuration, as well as applied Resources.

   - Search for Resources within a Package, Cluster or set of Clusters.
   - Visualize the relationship between Resources
   - Debug Resources

5. **Discovery**

   Discovery includes how to locate new packages, and examples.

   - Discover new publicly published packages from a market place or the web

#### FAQ

See [faq](tutorials/faq.md)

#### Templates and DSLs

Note: If the use of Templates or DSLs is strongly desired, they may be fully expanded into Resource
configuration to be used as a kpt package.  These artifacts used to generated Resource configuration
may be included in the package as supplements.

#### Env Vars

  COBRA_SILENCE_USAGE
  
    Set to true to silence printing the usage on error

  COBRA_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERRORS

    Set to true to print a stack trace on an error

  KPT_NO_PAGER_HELP

    Set to true to print the help to the console directly instead of through
    a pager (e.g. less)
