var DiffShort = `Show changes between local and upstream source package`
var DiffLong = `
Show changes between local and upstream source package.

Diff commands lets you answer the following questions:
  - What have I changed in my package relative to the upstream source package
  - What has changed in the upstream source package between the original source version and target version

You can specify a diffing tool with options to show the changes. By default, it
uses 'diff' commandline tool.

Args:

  LOCAL_PKG_DIR:
    Local package to compare. Command will fail if the directory doesn't exist, or does not
    contain a Kptfile.  Defaults to the current working directory.

  VERSION:
    A git tag, branch, ref or commit. Specified after the local_package with @ -- pkg_dir@version.
    Defaults to the local package version that was last fetched.

Envs:

  KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF:
   Commandline diffing tool (diff by default) that will be used to show changes. For ex.
   # Use meld to show changes
   KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=meld kpt diff

  KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS:
   Commandline options to use for the diffing tool. For ex.
   # Using "-a" diff option
   KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS="-a" kpt diff --diff-tool meld

Flags:
  diff-type:
    The type of changes to view (local by default). Following types are supported:
	 local: shows changes in local package relative to upstream source package at original version
	 remote: shows changes in upstream source package at target version relative to original version
	 combined: shows changes in local package relative to upstream source package at target version
	 3way: shows changes in local package and source package at target version relative to original version side by side

  diff-tool:
    Commandline tool (diff by default) for showing the changes.
	# Show changes using 'meld' commandline tool
	kpt diff @master --diff-tool meld

	Note that it overrides the KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable.

  diff-opts:
    Commandline options to use with the diffing tool.
	# Show changes using "diff" with recurive options
	kpt diff @master --diff-tool meld --diff-opts "-r"

	Note that it overrides the KPT_EXTERNAL_DIFF_OPTS environment variable.

var GetShort = `Fetch a package from a git repository`
var GetLong = `
Fetch a package from a git repository.

    kpt get REPO_URI[.git]/PKG_PATH[@VERSION] LOCAL_DEST_DIRECTORY [flags]

  REPO_URI:

    URI of a git repository containing 1 or more packages as subdirectories.
    In most cases the .git suffix should be specified to delimit the REPO_URI from the PKG_PATH,
    but this is not required for widely recognized repo prefixes.  If get cannot parse the repo
    for the directory and version, then it will print an error asking for '.git' to be specified
    as part of the argument.
    e.g. https://github.com/kubernetes/examples.git
    Specify - to read Resources from stdin and write to a LOCAL_DEST_DIRECTORY.

  PKG_PATH:

    Path to remote subdirectory containing Kubernetes Resource configuration files or directories.
    Defaults to the root directory.
    Uses '/' as the path separator (regardless of OS).
    e.g. staging/cockroachdb

  VERSION:

    A git tag, branch, ref or commit for the remote version of the package to fetch.
    Defaults to the repository master branch.
    e.g. @master

  LOCAL_DEST_DIRECTORY:

    The local directory to write the package to.
    e.g. ./my-cockroachdb-copy

    * If the directory does NOT exist: create the specified directory and write
      the package contents to it
    * If the directory DOES exist: create a NEW directory under the specified one,
      defaulting the name to the Base of REPO/PKG_PATH
    * If the directory DOES exist and already contains a directory with the same name
      of the one that would be created: fail

  --pattern string
  
    Pattern to use for writing files.  May contain the following formatting verbs
    %n: metadata.name, %s: metadata.namespace, %k: kind (default "%n_%k.yaml")

Initialize suggested package meta for a local config directory.

Any directory containing Kubernetes Resource Configuration may be treated as
remote package without the existence of additional packaging metadata.

* Resource Configuration may be placed anywhere under DIR as *.yaml files.
* DIR may contain additional non-Resource Configuration files.
* DIR must be pushed to a git repo or repo subdirectory.

Init will augment an existing local directory with packaging metadata to help
with discovery.

Init will:

* Create a Kptfile with package name and metadata if it doesn't exist
* Create a Man.md for package documentation if it doesn't exist.


    kpt init DIR [flags]

	# display subpackage documentation
	kpt man my-package/sub-package/`

var SubShort = `Perform package value substitutions`
var SubLong = `
Perform package value substitutions.

` + "`" + `sub` + "`" + ` looks for possible value substitutions in the package by reading the Kptfile.
To see the available substitutions for a package, run ` + "`" + `sub` + "`" + ` on the package directory
and they will be listed as sub commands.

  PKG_DIR
  
    A directory containing a Kptfile with substitutions specified.
    
  SUBSTITUTION_NAME
  
    The name of the substitution to perform.  Available substitutions names will
    be listed when running ` + "`" + `sub` + "`" + ` against the PKG_DIR with no other arguments.

  NEW_VALUE
    
    The new value to substitute for the marker.
    
The following is an example Kptfile containing a substitution, substituting an
int specified as a commandline arg for the string [PORT] in the provided field paths.

    # my-package/Kptfile
    apiVersion: kpt.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: KptFile
    substitutions:

      - path: ['spec', 'ports', '[name=http]', 'port']
      - path: ['spec', 'ports', '[name=http]', 'targetPort']
      long: 'long description of this substitution command'
      example: 'example of this substitution command'
      description: 'short description of this substitution command'

var SyncShort = `Sync package dependencies using a manifest`
var SyncLong = `
Sync uses a manifest to manage a collection of dependencies.

The manifest declares *all* direct dependencies of a package in a Kptfile.
When ` + "`" + `sync` + "`" + ` is run, it will ensure each dependency has been fetched at the
specified ref.

This is an alternative to managing package dependencies individually using
the ` + "`" + `get` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `update` + "`" + ` commands.

    kpt sync LOCAL_PKG_DIR [flags]

  LOCAL_PKG_DIR:
  
    Local package with dependencies to sync.  Directory must exist and contain a Kptfile.

#### Env Vars

  KPT_CACHE_DIR:
  
    Controls where to cache remote packages during updates.
    Defaults to ~/.kpt/repos/
    
#### Dependencies

For each dependency in the Kptfile, ` + "`" + `sync` + "`" + ` will ensure that it exists locally with the
matching repo and ref.

Dependencies are specified in the ` + "`" + `Kptfile` + "`" + ` ` + "`" + `dependencies` + "`" + ` field.  e.g.

    apiVersion: kpt.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Kptfile
    dependencies:
    - name: cockroachdb-storage
      path: local/destination/dir
      git:
        repo: "https://github.com/pwittrock/examples"
        directory: "staging/cockroachdb"
        ref: "v1.0.0"


Dependencies have following schema:

    name: <user specified name>
    path: <local path (relative to the Kptfile) to fetch the dependency to>
    git:
      repo: <git repository>
      directory: <sub-directory under the git repository>
      ref: <git reference -- e.g. tag, branch, commit, etc>
    updateStrategy: <strategy to use when updating the dependency -- see kpt help update for more details>
    ensureNotExists: <remove the dependency, mutually exclusive with git>

Dependencies maybe be updated by updating their ` + "`" + `git.ref` + "`" + ` field and running ` + "`" + `kpt sync` + "`" + `
against the directory.
`
var SyncExamples = `
  Example Kptfile to sync:

    # file: my-package-dir/Kptfile

    apiVersion: kpt.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: Kptfile
    # list of dependencies to sync
    dependencies:
    - name: cockroachdb-storage
      # fetch the remote dependency to this local dir
      path: local/destination/dir
      git:
        # repo is the git respository
        repo: "https://github.com/pwittrock/examples"
        # directory is the git subdirectory
        directory: "staging/cockroachdb"
        # ref is the ref to fetch
        ref: "v1.0.0"
    - name: app1
      path: local/destination/dir1
      git:
        repo: "https://github.com/pwittrock/examples"
        directory: "staging/javaee"
        ref: "v1.0.0"
      # set the strategy for applying package updates
      updateStrategy: "resource-merge"
    - name: app2
      path: local/destination/dir2
      # declaratively delete this dependency
      ensureNotExists: true

  Example invocation:

    # print the dependencies that would be modified
    kpt sync my-package-dir/ --dry-run

    # sync the dependencies
    kpt sync my-package-dir/`

    * fast-forward: fail without updating if the local package was modified since it was fetched.
    * alpha-git-patch: use 'git format-patch' and 'git am' to apply a patch of the
      changes between the source version and destination version.
      **REQUIRES THE LOCAL PACKAGE TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO A LOCAL GIT REPO.**
    * force-delete-replace: THIS WILL WIPE ALL LOCAL CHANGES TO
      THE PACKAGE.  DELETE the local package at local_pkg_dir/ and replace it
      with the remote version.
          
  -r, --repo string
  
    Git repo url for updating contents.  Defaults to the repo the package was fetched from.

  --dry-run
