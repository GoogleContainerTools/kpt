Functions are executables (that you can [write][Functions Developer Guide])
which accept a collection of Resource configuration as input, and emit a
collection of Resource configuration as output.

Functions can be packaged as container images, starlark scripts, or binary
executables.
`
var FnExamples = `
  # run the function defined by gcr.io/example.com/my-fn as a local container
  # against the configuration in DIR
  kpt fn run DIR/ --image gcr.io/example.com/my-fn

  # run the functions declared in files under FUNCTIONS_DIR/
  kpt fn run DIR/ --fn-path FUNCTIONS_DIR/

  # run the functions declared in files under DIR/
  kpt fn run DIR/
`

var EvalShort = `Locally execute function`
var EvalLong = `
  kpt fn eval DIR [flags]

If the container exits with non-zero status code, eval will fail and print the
container ` + "`" + `STDERR` + "`" + `.

  DIR:
    Path to a package directory.  Defaults to stdin if unspecified.
`
var EvalExamples = `
  # read the Resources from DIR, provide them to a container my-fun as input,
  # write my-fn output back to DIR
  kpt fn eval DIR/ --image gcr.io/example.com/my-fn

  kpt fn eval DIR/ --image gcr.io/example.com/my-fn:v1.0.0 -- foo=bar

  # run the function with config in FUNCTIONS_CONFIG_PATH against the Resources in DIR

  DIR:

  ORCHESTRATOR:
    Supported orchestrators are:
      - github-actions
      - cloud-build
      - gitlab-ci
      - jenkins
      - tekton
      - circleci
  OUTPUT_FILENAME:
    Specifies the filename of the generated pipeline. If omitted, the default
    output is stdout
