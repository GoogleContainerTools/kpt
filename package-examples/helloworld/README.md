# NAME

  helloworld

# SYNOPSIS

  Sample hello world package.  Showcases what a bare bones package is which doesn't do anything beyond
  declaring the current directory as a `kpt` package. 

  The utility of having something like this is that using this as a starting point you can:
  1. Publish it.
  2. Start adding hydration steps.
  3. Initialize the inventory and start using `kpt live` commands
