      ├── [wordpress-deployment.yaml]  Service wordpress
      ├── [wordpress-deployment.yaml]  PersistentVolumeClaim wp-pv-claim

  The fetched package contains [setters]. Invoke [list-setters] command to list
  the [setters] recursively in all the packages.
  
  $ kpt cfg list-setters wordpress/
  
      wordpress/
               NAME             VALUE      SET BY   DESCRIPTION   COUNT   REQUIRED  
        gcloud.core.project   PROJECT_ID                          3       No        
        image                 wordpress                           1       No        
        tag                   4.8                                 1       No        
        teamname              YOURTEAM                            3       Yes       
      
      wordpress/mysql/
               NAME             VALUE      SET BY   DESCRIPTION   COUNT   REQUIRED  
        gcloud.core.project   PROJECT_ID                          3       No        
        image                 mysql                               1       No        
        tag                   5.6                                 1       No        
        teamname              YOURTEAM                            3       Yes       
        
   You may notice that the [auto-setter] `gcloud.core.project` is already set if you
   have `gcloud` configured on your local.
  
  ### Provide the setter values
  Provide the values for all the [required setters]. By default, [set] 
  command is performed only on the resource files of provided package and not its 
  subpackages. `--recurse-subpackages(-R)` can be leveraged to run the command on 
  subpackages recursively.
  
  $ kpt cfg set wordpress/ teamname myteam -R
  
      wordpress/
      set 3 field(s)
      
      wordpress/mysql/
      set 3 field(s)
  
  ### Apply the package
  
  Apply all the contents of the package recursively to the cluster
  
  $ kubectl apply -f wordpress/ -R
